# Murmur.Chat - Back-end

This repo is for the back-end for my full-stack messaging app called Murmur.

The app is primairly built with Express but authentication is handled by Passport.js and JWT to ensure user authentication.

## Deployment

The front-end is currently deployed on Vercel. You can check it out: [here](https://murmur.chat). Additionally, to learn more about the front-end, you can check out the repo: [here](https://github.com/NewRedRoses/murmur-frontend)
